**Description**: ## **Assignment: Dynamic Post Page with OG Image Generation**

Objective:
Create a static post page using React or Vue.js that dynamically generates an Open Graph (og:image) based on the post content.

Requirements:

1. Post Page:
    - Develop a simple post page using React or Vue.js.
    - Include fields for title, content, and optionally an image, use any social media post design.
2. OG Image Generation:
    - Create a system to dynamically generate an og:image (1200x630 pixels) using the post content.
    - The og:image should include the post title, a snippet of the content, and any associated image. It should replicate the design of post itself
3. Integration:
    - Automatically add the og:image meta tag to the post page's HTML.
    - Ensure the generated image URL is accessible.
4. Styling:
    - Style the og:image to be visually appealing and readable.
    - Include branding elements (e.g., logo or color scheme).
5. Performance:
    - Optimize the image generation process for speed.

Deliverables:

1. A functional post page that generates appropriate og:images.
2. Source code for the implementation.
3. Brief documentation explaining how the system works.

Evaluation Criteria:

- Functionality of the post page and og:image generation
- Visual quality of the generated og:images
- Code quality and organization
- Performance of the image generation process

## I want to use a custom domain - is that possible?

We don't support custom domains (yet). If you want to deploy your project under your own domain, then we recommend GitHub Pages.

To use GitHub Pages you will need to follow these steps: 
- Deploy your project using GitHub Pages - instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site#creating-your-site)
- Configure a custom domain for your GitHub Pages site - instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site)
